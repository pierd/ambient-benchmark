# Input Lag Visualisation

A simple tool to visualise input lag in games.

The top square is synced with the server and as such it's affected by the input lag.
The bottom square is controlled directly on the client.
The delay is added locally to the client and simulates longer frame processing time.

If the squares stop being aligned then some messages were lost.

## Controls
AD/left-right = move
WS/up-down = add or remove delay
R = reset square positions
space = toggle square visibility
